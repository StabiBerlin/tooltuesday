In 1838 Ken\ntucky gave school suffrage to wid\nows, and in 1845 the law was\nchanged, making widows and spin\nsters having taxable property eligi\nble to vote for school trustees except\nin cities governed by charters. In\n1861 Kansas gave school suffrage\ntoj all women. In 1869 England\ngave municipal suffrage to single\nwomen and widows, and Wyoming\ngive full suffrage to all women.\nSchool suffrage was granted in 1875\n,by Michigan and Minnesota, in 1876\nby Colorado, in 1878 by New Hamp\nshire and Oregon, in 1879 by Mas\n' • • 4 1IOA i _i_\nIII locnj ify\nand Vermont.

In 1886, New Brunswick and\nOntario gave municipal suffrage to\nsingle women and widows, and\nWashington gave school suffrage to\nall women. In 1887, municipal\nsuffrage was extended to all women\nin Kansas, and school suffrage in\nNorth and South Dakota, Montana,\nArizona and New Jersey. In 1891,\nschool suffrage was granted in Illi\nnois. In 1892, municipal suffrage\nwas extended to single women and\nwidows in the Province of Quebec.\nIn 1893, school suffrage was grant\ned in Connecticut, and full suffrage\nin Colorado and New Zealand. In\n1894, school suffrage was granted\nin Ohio; a limited municipal suf\nfrage in Iowa, and parish and dis\ntrict suffrage in England td women\nboth married and single.

Altgeld of\nIllinois addressed about 2000 peo\nple in the Academy of Music, Brook\nlyn, Monday. The meeting was\nunder the auspices of the Demo\ncratic League of Kings County.\nHenry George presided, ami intro\nduced Mr. Altgeld, who was greeted\nwith hearty applause.\nMr. Altgeld, in the course of his\nspeech, said: ‘*A whole generation\nhas paid at the war debt and has\nreduced it by one halt. Yet such\nhas been the Governmental policy\nthat to-day it will require twice as\nmuch of our products to pay the\nremainder as would have been nec\nessary to pay it all when it was\ncreated. Being a producing and\ndebtor Nation, it was a crime to leg\nislate exclusively in favor of the\ncreditor classes of Kurope and thus\ndestroy the purchasing power of\nour people.\n“There must ultimately come a\nsystem of finance or exchange that\nwill have a philosophic basis and\nwill not restrict human efforts. Bui\nuntil this does come we demand the\nrestoration of the bimetallic system\nas it formerly existed in our country\nbecause it was the best thus far\ngiven the world.\n“We were promised prosperity;\nit has not come, and it lequires no\nprophet to see that uno’er existing\nconditions no permanent prosperity\ncan come. A spurt of activity un\nder McKinley conditions means the\nmore certain death of free institu\ntions; it means that the poison of\ncorruption shall go oil until every\norgan of the body is destroyed.\n“In every State the people are\naroused; they see their condition\ngrowing worse; they see the hope of\ntheir children disappearing; fhey\nsee poverty hanging over the future;\nthey see the black flag of hunger\nAbating over some of the richest\nsections of God’s earth, and they\nare crying for justice. My friends,\nSchilling's Best\ntea baktaf powder\ncoffee flavoring extracts\naoda and apices\nare as good as they can be\n—not prudishly or foolishly\nDr extravagantly perfect\nn\nthat cry will free the Amerioan peo\nple. Even if we should be borne\ndown again and again, the voice of\nhumanity will arise from the dust\nand drive the money changers out\nof the temple and the traitors out\nof the land. The Benedict Arnold\nof 1780 sleeps on English soil. Let\nthe Benedict Arnolds of this age\nmake their graves beside him.”\ni ?» ... ..—\nThirteen Jarere te CwiWet\n“I heard the late Jndge John R.\nGrace of the Court of Appeals of\nKentucky set aside the verdict of a\njury once under circumstances that\nto my mind did him infinite credit,”\nsaid Representative John S. Rhea,\nof that State, at the Wellington.\n“It seems that a poor woman,\nwho was on the verge of starvation\nand who was the sole support of\nfour little children, went into a\nneighbor’s smoke-house and pur\nloined a piece of bacon. The proof\nwas positive, and the jury reluc\ntantly returned a verdict of guilty.\nWhen the finding of the jury was\nread Judge Grace, who at that time\npresided over the Fourteenth Judi-i\ncial District, rising to his feet, said\nin the most emphatic tones:\n“ ‘The Court orders that the ver\ndict in this case be set aside, and I\nwant to declare here that in all\ncases where an unfortunate woman\nis on trial for stealing food, taken\nto keep her offspring from starving,\nit will require thirteen men to con\nvict her of the crime in this court.\n* * * The defendant is dis\ncharged from custody.’\n“The announcement was greeted\nwith applause from the sjiectators,\nand the general sentiment was that\nJudge Grace had acted not only as\na chivalrous man, but that bis rul\ning was right. Theft to keep inno\ncent babes from perishing of hun\nger can scarcely be called a crime.\n— Washington Post.\n«iol<! Bfinnai h tl»e (tea.\nCapt. Robert Linbridge, of the\nschooner Lila and Mattie, which\nsailed for the South seas last week\nwith a party of scientists, told the\nstory of the discovery of what is\nprobably the richest gold-l^aring\nledge of rock in the world. The\ncaptain spent several months on the\ncoast of Alaska last Summer, and\nit was while cruising from point to\npoint that he made the discovery.\nAs the coast yas new to him, he\nwas compelled to d*> much sound\ning. One evening the lead came up\nwith a lot of yellow particles at\ntached to it. He cast anchor in the\nvicinity, and next morning found\nthat 'the anchor also had yellow\nmetal oh it. This caused him to\ninvestigate, and he found a quartz\nledge running from the mountain\nout into the sea; and found that the\nquartz was thickly veined with gold.\nHe secured many specimens, and\nbrought them with his sounding\nlead to Sah Francisco, and assayers\npronounce it the richest lot of quartz\nthat they have seen. On the rejH»rt\nof the experts a company is being\nformed to investigate and locate the\nledge, and when the captain returns\nfrom the'South seas he will take a\nparty to the spot. Those who are\nin the secret are doing all in their\npower to keep it dark until they\nBhall have fully established their\nclaims. The captain said the ledge\nis 30 feet wide where it has been\nwashed by the sea, but that on the\nBhore it cap be traced only by the\noutcroppings. As the climate there\nwill permit of work six months of\nthe year, this ledge can l>e worked\nto much greater advantage than\nother Alaska mines.\nW*tw SspleratiM.\nThe Atf, rican Museum of Natu\nral History issoon to begin a system\natic errplanrtj^ 0f the coasts of .\nAsia and Nc^^ America, from the ,\nA moor River jn Asia to the Colum- .\n,bia River on our continent. The\nobject is to stuoy the various peonies .\ninhabiting thss, regions, in order\nto settle if post]hie, the question\nwhether the Asutieg once crossed ,\nto America by w*y of Kai»«b“k‘‘«r ,\nand the Aluetian Islands. Ampng\nthe principle things studied will he\nthe various languages now 9poken\nin Northeastern Asia and North*,\nwestern America, and some idea of\nthe extent of this subject may be\nobtained from the alleged fact that .\n“being between the Columbia River\nand Bering Strait ten languages are\nfound that are fundamentally dis\ntinct, and these languages have\nthirty-seven dialects which are\nmutually unintelligible.” Oil the\nAsaitic side, it appears, the confu\nsion of tongues is not quite so great,\nalthough the number of distinct\nlanguages spoken there is seven,\nand the number of mutually unin\ntelligible dialects ten. The ex\nplorations are to cover a period of\nsix years, and the money has been\nfurnished by a wealthy New Yorker,\nMr. Morris K. Jessup.\nReasons Why Chamberlain's Celle.\nCholera and Diarrhoea Remedy Is\nthe Best.\n1. Because it affords almost in\nstant relief in case of pain in the\nstomach, colic and cholera morbus.\n2.

I\nwas lying at one of the Navigator\nislands once when some natives\ncame aboard. It was an awfully\nhot day, and I had been getting\nsome ice up from below. The na\ntives looked at it curiously, so I\nhanded one a chunk. The moment\nit touched his hand he dropped it\nlike hot shot and looked at his\npalms to see if they were hurne 1.\nAfter a deal of jabbering they all\nsat around it and watched it as it\nmelted. They couldn’t understand ■\nit, at all, and when there was\nnothing left but a wet spot on the, ^\ndeck they sat around and discussed\nthe phenomenon. I put a piece of '\nice in my mouth and then gave*\nthem some. They shifted it from\none hand to the other, put the tips\npf their tongues on it gingerly and\nfinally ate the chunk. It was a '\nSource of great wonder to them. 1 “\nBasehall “fingers” yield to Trib.\nIT\nCure t\nlute f\ntong»\nBator*\n•M*	https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84022053/1897-07-10/ed-1/seq-1.json

The cuu\nens was held, and there was uo fight at\nall. On the contrary, the meeting was\nentirely harmonious and not even any\nshow of hard feelings was indulged in by\nanybody.

A man had subscribed to\na fund raised by an Iowa Methodist\nKpiscopal church, but when an at\ntempt was made to collect the sub\nscription lie repudiated it on the\nground, tirst, that there had lieen uo\nconsideration and hence the contract\ndid not bind him. This point was\ndisposed of as a quibble, the court\nassuming the subscription would not\nhave been inn le without sufficient con\nsideration, whether tangible or not. A\nmore serious contention was that the\nsubscription, being made on Sunday, j\nwua void. Hie court held that while\nan ordinary contract made on Sun\nday was illegal, one to do goxl could\nnot t>e so considered, "l'lie custom\ntaking offerings on the tirst day of\n| the week has existed from titue im\nmemorial." says the decision, "and uo\none has supposed this to be prohibit\ned by the statute. Otherwise the\ndeacon; or others iu passing around\nthe hat and the minister iudirectiue\nthis to be dune, are amenable to the\npenalties of the law. The founder of\nChristianity held it to be lawful to\ni do good on the Sabbath day." Hence\n? tho court decided that tho contract is\nvalid. Aside from the interest in the\n] decision it is one of real value. There\n| is a general disposition on the part of\n| some people to seek the reputation of\ndning good works bv subscribing to\nvarious churitics, but they often ueg\nj lect to pay when the time comes.

SUFFRAGE IN COLORADO\nThe following is from the Woman's\nColumn, a paper published in the in\nterest of the equal suffrage question:\n"Because false rumors are circulat\ning in other ?tatee concerning the re\nsults of equal suffrage in Colorado,\nthe friends of the cause desire to pre\nsent a truthful and unprejudiced\nstatement ot fact. The sigDaturea of\nmen and women who have official\nrecognition are appenJed to this\nstatement, in ordr that the office may\ngive weight when Dames are un\nknown. The siguatures iuclude\nprominent eociety women, as well as\nthose distinguished in intellectual\nand philanthropic work. The list\nmight be indefinitely prolonged were\nmore than a representative number\npossible.\n"We, citizens of the State of Colo\nrado, desire, as lovers of truth and\njustice to give our testimony to the\nvalue of equal suffrage.\n"We believe that the greateet good\nof the home, the State and the Nation\nis advanced through the operation of\nequal suffrage. The evils predicted\nhave not come to pass. The benefits\nclaimed for it have been secured, or\nare in process of development. A\nvery large proportion of Colorado\nwomen have conscientiously accepted\ntheir responsibility as citizens. In\n1894 more than half the total vote for\nGovernor was cast by women. Be\ntween 85 and 90 per cent of the women\nof the State vote at that time. The\nexact vote of the last election has not\nyet been estimared, but :h re is reason\nto believe that the proportional vote of\nwomen was as large as in previous\nyears.\n"The vote of good women, like that\nof good men, is involved in the evils\nresulting from the abuse of our pres\nent political system; but the vote of\nwomen is noticeably more conscien\ntious than that of men, and wiJ be an\nimportant factor in bringing about a\nmuch better order."\nThe above statement is signed by\nthe leading men anr! women of Colo\nrado, among many whos judgment\nhas never been questioned. Lack f\nspace forbids the publication of the\nlist.\nLITTLE PETE.\nLittle Pete ttie Chinese Boss was\nkilled by higabindeis last Saturday\nin San Francisco. He came to San\nFrancisco years ago a mere boy and\nstudied American institures. He saw\nthat rascals thrived in San Francisco\nand went to an American school to\nget his start. He sood branched out\nas a jury briber then a general mani\npulator of men and the lever he used\nto do business with was always spot\ncash. He bribed judges, juries and\njockies. He amassed great wealth at\nhis calling and held His own with the\nbest California polititians and busi\nness men. He had no conscience\nwhatever and was the equal of Buck\nley and Rainey and the rest of the\npueh. He gave to Buckley the name\nof the "Blind White Devil" and it has\nstuck to him ever since.\nThe Sam Yup Company hired the\nassassians who fired the shots which\nended his life and if the same com\npany would take a contract to "re\nremove" some or the white politians\nin California of the Little Pete stamp\nit would be an excellent thing for the\ntax payers.\nWill Langevin, of mint ease repu\ntation, is the happy possessor of a son\nborn on Jan. 11th.\nThe ravy officials have chosen olive\ngreen as the righting color of the tew\nDavy.
